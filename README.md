# üîê Cryptographic Cipher Learning

This repository is a collection of Python programs that demonstrate the working of classical cryptographic ciphers. These implementations are part of my ongoing learning journey in the field of cryptography and cybersecurity.

## üìå About

Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties. Classical ciphers form the foundation of modern cryptographic systems and help in understanding the core principles of encryption, decryption, and secure key usage.

This repository contains implementations of basic transposition and substitution ciphers to understand:
- How encryption scrambles plain text into cipher text
- How keys influence the transformation process

Each program is written in Python with clean and modular functions, accompanied by inline comments for better understanding.
